<p>I’m pleased to unveil this website, which I hope will be an effective means to
connect with other researchers and potential students or postdocs. After brief
debate, we settled on the name “EPIC” for our research group. This
name is indeed an acronym (<u>E</u>xploration of <u>P</u>lanetary <u>I</u>ces
  and <u>C</u>limates), but also evokes the spirit of brave and uninhibited
  exploration, a common characteristic of our group members.</p>
