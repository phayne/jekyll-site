Regolith is the layer of loose material covering the surfaces of most solid planets.
Crustal materials are broken down by impacts of all sizes, which fracture rock
and spray fine particles to great distances. We can learn about these impacts
and the space environment by studying the best-known example of regolith - the Moon's.

We used data from the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/index.html" target="\_blank">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's</a><a href="https://diviner.ucla.edu" target="\_blank">Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment</a>
to measure and map the <i>thermophysical</i> properties (such as density or porosity) of the Moon's uppermost regolith.
Our results tell a story of more than a billion years of violent impacts and
volcanic eruptions, expressed through intricate patterns just beneath the lunar surface.
Some of these features have never been seen before, and are ripe for further study.
Many of the underlying processes also occur on other planetary bodies, making the
Moon a "cornerstone" for understanding other planets.
