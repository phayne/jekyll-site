Snowfall in the polar winter of Mars is unlike anything on Earth: temperatures
plummet and the martian air (made mostly of CO$$_2$$) begins to freeze.
In the darkness of polar night, flurries and snow storms quietly blanket
the surface with "dry ice", drawing fresh air into the polar atmosphere to fill the
void. This CO$$_2$$ cycle strongly influences Mars' global climate
and energy balance.

We used data from the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/spacecraft/sc-instru-mcs.html">
Mars Climate Sounder</a> (MCS) to investigate polar snowfall and its effect on the
present-day climate. MCS is an infrared sounder onboard the
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/main/index.html">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>
spacecraft, which seeks to reveal the history of water and its role in shaping
potentially habitable environments on Mars. Our ongoing research is revealing
new insights into the exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the polar caps
and atmosphere.
