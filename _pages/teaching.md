Through partnerships with educators and scientists in local communities, we are
seeking to engage young students in the exploration of their world through the
scientific method. Driven by their curiosity, these students develop hypotheses,
seek data, and formulate their own conclusions. The capstone of previous
programs has been acquiring images of Mars from using <a href="https://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/" target="\_blank">HiRISE</a> camera onboard
NASA's <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mro" target="\_blank">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>. More information can be found over at
<a href="http://www.adastra.world/" target="\_blank">Ad Astra Academy</a>.

<blockquote>
Science and exploration shouldn't be privileges granted through special access.
Young people in under-resourced communities throughout the developing world
deserve the same opportunities afforded to students at the best schools in
America.
