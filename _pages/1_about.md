<strong>Welcome!</strong>

New perspectives on the Solar System are emerging as interplanetary spacecraft explore distant worlds.
Observations reveal *active* planetary systems: <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/mars-snow-summer-water-ice-planets-space-science/" target="\_blank">snow and ice</a>,
<a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/11455" target="\_blank">volcanoes</a> and
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/lunar/index.html" target="\_blank">impacts</a>, <a href="https://www.planetfour.org/#/about" target="\_blank">jets</a> and <a href="http://ciclops.org/view/6226/CASSINI-FINDS-PLETHORA-OF-PLUMES-HOTSPOTS-AT-ENCELADUS" target="\_blank">geysers</a> -- motion and change are
ever-present.

I am an assistant professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the
University of Colorado Boulder. My <a href="research/">research</a> focuses on
the thermal behavior of terrestrial planets and moons, especially icy worlds.
Data from spacecraft and Earth-based observatories enable my group
to investigate planetary atmospheres and surfaces. We develop physics-based
models and perform quantitative analysis to interpret remote sensing data.


Here, you will find brief summaries of some of my group's ongoing <a href="research/">research</a>,
along with tools and sporadic <a href="blog/">blog</a> entries about how we pursue these
projects.
