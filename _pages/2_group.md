The <u>E</u>xploration of <u>P</u>lanetary <u>I</u>ces and <u>C</u>limates
(EPIC) group in the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics
(<a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu" target="\_">LASP</a>)
at CU Boulder investigates the atmospheres and surfaces of icy
worlds using numerical models and data from spacecraft and ground-based
observatories. We are especially interested in the thermal environments and
behavior of volatiles on these bodies, particularly in their polar regions.
Our quantitative approach includes the development of numerical heat, vapor,
and radiative transfer models with wide applicability to problems in planetary
science. Data analysis efforts focus on multi-spectral and hyper-spectral
imaging for compositional studies, thermal infrared atmospheric sounding and
surface mapping, and inversion techniques.

<p>
Our group is composed of researchers at all levels, from undergraduates to
postdoctoral scholars. We welcome <a href="mailto:Paul.Hayne@Colorado.edu">
inquiries</a> for possible opportunities from
individuals representing a diverse range of backgrounds. The EPIC group is a
welcoming environment, where diverse perspectives are respected and everyone is
valued for their contributions.

  <td>Dr. Paul Hayne is an assistant professor in the department of <a href="https://colorado.edu/aps" target="\_blank">Astrophysical & Planetary Sciences</a>, and <a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu" target="\_blank">LASP</a>. He grew up near Seattle, Washington. Paul joined the <a href="https://colorado.edu" target="\_blank">CU</a> faculty in January, 2018, after serving for five years as a research scientist at NASA’s <a href="https://jpl.nasa.gov" target="\_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> in Pasadena, CA. Paul earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at <a href="https://earth.stanford.edu/geophysics" target="\_blank">Stanford University</a>, and his PhD at <a href="https://epss.ucla.edu/research-areas/planetary-science/" target="\_blank">UCLA</a> (with David Paige). He did his postdoc at <a href="http://web.gps.caltech.edu/options/planetary/" target="\_blank">Caltech</a> (with Oded Aharonson), where he developed numerical models for investigating the behavior of volatiles on the Moon and Ceres.</td>

  <td>Dr. Ganna (Anya) Portyankina is a LASP Research Associate, whose research focuses on the seasonal behavior of CO2 frosts on Mars. Anya is from Ukraine. She earned her Master degree in Physics and Astronomy from Kharkiv National University and her PhD, or more precisely, Dr. rer. nat. – Doctor rerum naturalium – in Astrophysics from University of Göttingen in Germany. Anya’s main scientific interest is ices in the Solar System, from Martian polar caps to icy satellites of giant planets. She plans observations and works with data from HiRISE and CaSSIS, and works in the low-temperature labs to simulate environments that can host CO<sub>2</sub> ice.</td>
