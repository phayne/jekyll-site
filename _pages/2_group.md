The <u>E</u>xploration of <u>P</u>lanetary <u>I</u>ces and <u>C</u>limates
(EPIC) group in the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics
(<a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu" target="\_">LASP</a>)
at CU Boulder investigates the atmospheres and surfaces of icy
worlds using numerical models and data from spacecraft and ground-based
observatories. We are especially interested in the thermal environments and
behavior of volatiles on these bodies, particularly in their polar regions.
Our quantitative approach includes the development of numerical heat, vapor,
and radiative transfer models with wide applicability to problems in planetary
science. Data analysis efforts focus on multi-spectral and hyper-spectral
imaging for compositional studies, thermal infrared atmospheric sounding and
surface mapping, and inversion techniques.

<p>
Our group is composed of researchers at all levels, from undergraduates to
postdoctoral scholars. We welcome <a href="mailto:Paul.Hayne@Colorado.edu">
inquiries</a> for possible opportunities from
individuals representing a diverse range of backgrounds. The EPIC group is a
welcoming environment, where diverse perspectives are respected and everyone is
valued for their contributions.
